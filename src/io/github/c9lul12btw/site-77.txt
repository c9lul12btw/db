> SITE-77 (Storage SITE-77)

One of the Foundation's largest storage facilities, SITE-77 was initially
built in 1924 in southern Italy and served as an Italian facility until the
second World War, when it was damaged by Allied bombing and subsequently destroyed
by a containment breach. SITE-77 was taken over by the Foundation and rebuilt
in 1944.
